# codes
This is a repository of codes or solutions that were written by me for predefined questions. They will be mostly in java because I have been working with this programming langauge since 2017. There codes will either be some mostly interviewed datastructure and algorithmic problems or some predifiend problems to print something.
In this repository p will indicate problem and s will indicate solution for example , p1 is problem number 1 and s1 is solution for that particular problem.
